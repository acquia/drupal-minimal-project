Acquia Drupal Minimal Project
====

This project template provides a minimal Drupal 9 application to be hosted on Acquia. It includes only essential dependencies and configuration to install and host Drupal 9 on Acquia. It is based on the [Drupal Recommended Project](https://github.com/drupal/recommended-project/tree/9.3.x), with only a few modifications:

- A relocated docroot for compatibility with Acquia hosting
- The addition of Drush
- The addition of Asset Packagist for compatibility with Lightning

This project targets experienced developers who prefer to build a new application from the ground up. If you prefer a more complete out-of-the-box Drupal 9 experience on Acquia Cloud, consider trying the [Acquia Drupal Recommended Project](https://github.com/acquia/drupal-recommended-project) instead.

## Installation and usage

Create a new project using Composer:
```
composer create-project --no-interaction acquia/drupal-minimal-project
```

Once you create the project, you can and should customize `composer.json` and the rest of the project to suit your needs. You will receive updates from any dependent packages, but not from the project template itself. It's yours to keep!

For instance, you can add a new package by running the following command and committing the changed `composer.json` and `composer.lock` to Git:
```
composer require acquia/blt
```
